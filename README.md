# Eikon-docker
[![Test](https://github.com/tschm/eikon-docker/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tschm/eikon-docker/actions/)
[![Release](https://github.com/tschm/eikon-docker/workflows/Release/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tschm/eikon-docker/actions/)
Use Refinitiv's Python Eikon Data API within a Docker container. The host of this package has to have the Eikon desktop installed.

## Installation
```python
pip install eikon-docker
```

## Hints

I am using Make throughout all my projects. It's not a native Windows tool. You can however make it work following

## Usage

I assume you are familiar with docker. If not, this package has no additional benefit for you. I recommend to use

https://pypi.org/project/eikon/

However, if you share my love for docker you may prefer having a somewhat cleaner setup and package all tools neatly in one
container. I have not changed the API etc.

All the Eikon commands you are familiar will continue to work (or continue to be broken). The difference is now that the Eikon code
lives together with its dependencies in a container. Here's a little fragment:

```
import eikon as ek
print(ek.__version__)

import logging
import http.client

http.client.HTTPConnection.debuglevel = 1

logging.basicConfig()
logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
requests_log = logging.getLogger("requests.packages.urllib3")
requests_log.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
requests_log.propagate = True

if __name__ == '__main__':
    ek.set_app_key('084dd01c11d749f884ba12d60c2673697ec0fa2e')

    df = ek.get_timeseries(["MSFT.O"],
                           start_date="2016-01-01",
                           end_date="2016-01-10")
    print(df)
```



## License

Refinitiv has released the Python Eikon Data API using the Apache 2.0 license. By design this package will only work if installed
within a container that is running on a host with an Eikon desktop installed. This approach is respected within this package and
we are essentially using `host.docker.internal` to access services running on the Windows host from within a container. 
This is a somewhat dubious approach and you may want to read more about it here

https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/networking/

Whatever you do with this package note that neither Refinitiv nor myself will be responsible for any damage. Please feel free to raise an issue though.
